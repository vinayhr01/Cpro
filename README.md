# Cpro

This repository consists of a project called Offline food ordering and billing system.

    This project is similar to people using different softwares to take orders of food which is predominantly seen in prestigious hotels.
    Since many don't use such methods take orders, as it is expensive for hotels to fund them or for any such unknown reason many hotels have not accomodated them.
    Therefore this is a project in C which does the job of taking food orders and displays bill which allows cancellation of food at times when customer doesn't wish for the item.
    
    This repository consists of 2 project files which does the same job in a different way.
