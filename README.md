# Cpro

This repository consists of a project called Offline food ordering and billing system.

    This project is similar to people using different softwares 
    to take orders of food which is predominantly seen in prestigious hotels.
    Since many don't use such methods to take orders, as a reason of expensiveness 
    for hotels to fund them or 
    for any such other possible reason many hotels have not accomodated them.
   
    Therefore this is a project in C which does the job of taking food orders 
    and displays bill 
    which allows cancellation of food at times when customer doesn't wish for the item also.

# Features
    Some of the features are, 
    1. Ordering and cancelling of food based on required quantity.
    2. Cost calculation of food based on quantity of food ordered.
    3. Involves producing bill inclusive of GST.
